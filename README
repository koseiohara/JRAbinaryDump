About this script
	This script generates a binary file from JRA55 or JRA3Q with wgrib or wgrib2.
	As of updated time, this script has two options : ALL date and time in the designated period or only DJF.
	Generated binary file (hereafter OFILE) can be read by the Fortran direct access option.
	This script also generate a new control file for the binary file.


What this script do
	First, a temporary file is generated from grib file at specific time with the wgrib or wgrib2 command.
	Then, data in the temporary file is added to OFILE with cat command.
	After that, rm command remove the temporary file.

	This three step process is repeated for designated period.
	If a file whose path and name are completely same as OFILE exist, the file is removed after execution.
	If this script tried to read binary file and cannot find the file, this script generate a control file and stop immediately with
	error messages.

	Function MKCTL() read original control file of the dataset and generate new one for new binary file.
	At that time, options, tdef, var are newly setted for the binary file and lines of index, comments, dtype are removed.
	Number of tdef is counted when generating binary file and reflected for the control file.
	If functions for reading grib files are commented out, number of tdef is setted as default value : 120000.


Usage
	You need to rewrite only some variables written in first 15 lines.

	YEAR_INI :	the first year of the period
	YEAR_FIN :	the last year of the period

	DATA_DIR :	the directory that the dataset is stored.
				For example, /mnt/sola2/global_data/JRA55_official/Grib/Daily/anl_p125 for JRA55 6hourly anl_p125_hgt.
							 /mnt/ice09/JRA3Q/anl_p125 for JRA3Q 6hourly anl_p125_hgt.
	TITLE	 :	The string to the left of the period in the grib file name.
				For example, anl_p125_hgt for JRA3Q Geopotential Height data in anl_p125.
	VAR		 :	Variable name displaied by "wgrib (grib filename)" for JRA55 or "wgrib2 (grib filename)" for JRA3Q.
				Note that this is different from variable name written in control files.
				For example, HGT for Geopotential Height data and UGRD for u-component data.
	PERIOD	 :	ALL, DJF, MAM, JJA, and SON are available now.
				If ALL, all data from YEAR_INI/01/01 to YEAR_FIN/12/31 is dumped in OFILE.
				If DJF, only December, January, February data from YEAR_INI/12/01 to YEAR_FIN/02/28 (YEAR_FIN/02/29 if leap year) is
				dumped in OFILE.
	DATASET	 :	JRA55 or JRA3Q


Outputs
	OFILE and control file are generated in directory {DATASET}_{YEAR_INI}_{YEAR_FIN}.
	If this directory does not exist, mkdir is executed.
	Name of OFILE is        {DATASET}_{TITLE}_{YEAR_INI}_{YEAR_FIN}_{PERIOD}.bin
	Name of control file is {DATASET}_{TITLE}_{YEAR_INI}_{YEAR_FIN}_{PERIOD}.ctl
	You can change these names by changing definisions of OUTDIR, OFILE, and CTL_NEW.
	Date and time when wgrib/wgrib2 command is executed and read file name are written in a log file.
